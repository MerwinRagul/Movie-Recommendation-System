# Movie-Recommendation-System
In this iPython Notebook, I have created basic Movie Recommender System with Python.

It is an extension from the project: https://github.com/Merwin Ragul/Movie-Recommendation Sysyem in Python The Dataset used is subset of MovieLens Dataset

Extension: Have created a text input bar to add your movie whose recommendation you want. Output will give you top 4 matches that are recommended movies.
